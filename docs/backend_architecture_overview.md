# Backend Architecture Overview for Nexus Vocality

This document outlines a conceptual microservice-based backend architecture for Nexus Vocality, designed for scalability, modularity, and extensibility.

## Guiding Principles

*   **Decoupling**: Services should be independent and communicate via well-defined APIs.
*   **Scalability**: Each service should be scalable independently based on its load.
*   **Modularity**: Core features (recording, analysis, AI, presets, user management) should be encapsulated within distinct services.
*   **Extensibility**: The architecture should easily accommodate new features and integrations.

## Core Services (Microservices)

Based on the project requirements, the following microservices are proposed:

1.  **User Service**:
    *   Responsibilities: User authentication (JWT, OAuth2, 2FA), profile management, RBAC (Role-Based Access Control), account settings, privacy controls.
    *   Tech Stack Idea: Node.js (e.g., Express.js/Fastify), PostgreSQL/MongoDB. Could integrate with Supabase Auth or a similar managed service.

2.  **Vocal Recording Service**:
    *   Responsibilities: Handling audio uploads, temporary storage of recordings, format conversion (potentially using ffmpeg.wasm or a server-side equivalent).
    *   Tech Stack Idea: Node.js, object storage (e.g., S3, Firebase Storage, Supabase Storage).

3.  **AI Analysis Service**:
    *   Responsibilities: Orchestrating calls to various AI models (TensorFlow.js execution, Whisper, custom models) for vocal analysis (pitch, timbre, emotion, clarity, prosody, fluency). Managing AI model versions and training pipelines (conceptually).
    *   Tech Stack Idea: Python (Flask/FastAPI for ML-heavy tasks) or Node.js with connections to Genkit flows or dedicated AI inference servers. Could leverage serverless functions (e.g., Google Cloud Functions, AWS Lambda).

4.  **Preset Management Service**:
    *   Responsibilities: Storing, retrieving, and managing user-created and community presets. Handling preset sharing and versioning.
    *   Tech Stack Idea: Node.js, NoSQL (e.g., MongoDB) or SQL database.

5.  **Training System Service**:
    *   Responsibilities: Managing personalized training plans, tracking user progress, daily schedules, gamification logic (achievements, challenges).
    *   Tech Stack Idea: Node.js, SQL database.

6.  **Export Service**:
    *   Responsibilities: Generating exportable files (audio, audiovisual with spectrograms, AI feedback reports).
    *   Tech Stack Idea: Node.js, potentially integrating with headless browsers or image/video manipulation libraries.

## Data Layer & API Gateway

*   **Database Strategy**:
    *   Consider a polyglot persistence approach, choosing the best database type for each service (e.g., SQL for structured user data, NoSQL for flexible presets).
    *   **Supabase** or **Hasura GraphQL** can serve as powerful BaaS/GraphQL layers, potentially simplifying data access and management for some services or providing a unified API gateway.
        *   **Supabase**: Provides auth, database (Postgres), storage, and serverless functions. Could host several microservices or their data layers.
        *   **Hasura GraphQL**: Provides an instant GraphQL API over your databases, simplifying data fetching for the frontend and between services.

*   **API Gateway**:
    *   Responsibilities: A single entry point for all client requests, routing requests to the appropriate microservice, handling cross-cutting concerns like authentication, rate limiting, and logging.
    *   Tech Stack Idea: Managed services like AWS API Gateway, Google Cloud Endpoints, or self-hosted solutions like Express Gateway, Kong.

## Communication Between Services

*   **Synchronous**: REST or gRPC for direct service-to-service calls.
*   **Asynchronous**: Message queues (e.g., RabbitMQ, Kafka, Google Pub/Sub) for event-driven communication, decoupling services further (e.g., when a recording is uploaded, an event is published for the AI Analysis Service to pick up).

## Scalability & Deployment

*   **Containerization**: Docker for packaging services.
*   **Orchestration**: Kubernetes or managed container services (e.g., Google Kubernetes Engine, AWS EKS, Firebase App Hosting with Cloud Run) for deployment, scaling, and management.
*   **Serverless**: Utilize serverless functions for event-driven processing or less frequently accessed services to optimize costs.

## Integration with Frontend

*   The Next.js frontend will interact with the backend primarily through the API Gateway.
*   Server Actions in Next.js can call these backend APIs.
*   Genkit flows (like those in `src/ai/flows/`) would be refactored to call these backend microservices instead of performing all logic directly, or the microservices themselves could host Genkit flows.

This architecture provides a robust foundation for Nexus Vocality's growth, allowing for independent development, deployment, and scaling of its various powerful features.
