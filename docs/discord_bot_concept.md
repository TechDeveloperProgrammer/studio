# Discord Bot Concept for Nexus Vocality

This document outlines ideas for a Discord bot to integrate Nexus Vocality features into a server, fostering community and practice.

## Goals

*   Allow users to interact with Nexus Vocality features directly from Discord.
*   Facilitate sharing of presets and vocal progress within a community.
*   Provide tools for vocal practice and feedback via Discord.

## Core Bot Functionality & Commands

### User Account Linking
*   **OAuth2 Integration**: Users should be able to link their Nexus Vocality account to their Discord account securely.
    *   ` /nexus link `: Initiates the OAuth2 flow.
    *   ` /nexus unlink `: Removes the account linkage.

### Vocal Recording & Analysis (Conceptual)
Direct audio recording in Discord is complex. A more feasible approach might involve the bot guiding users to record via the web app and then submit for analysis.

*   ` /voz grabar `: Provides a link to the Nexus Vocality web app's recording page.
*   ` /voz analizar [adjuntar archivo de audio OR URL a grabaci√≥n] `:
    *   User uploads an audio file or provides a link (e.g., to a recording made in Nexus Vocality and shared).
    *   Bot submits this to the Nexus Vocality AI analysis service.
    *   Bot returns a summary of the analysis or a link to the full report in the web app.

### Preset Management
*   ` /preset listar `: Lists the user's public/sharable presets from their linked Nexus Vocality account.
*   ` /preset compartir [nombre_preset] `: Shares a specific preset to the current channel or a dedicated presets channel. Bot displays preset details.
*   ` /preset buscar [palabra_clave] `: Searches for shared presets within the server community.
*   ` /preset importar [id_preset_compartido] `: Adds a shared preset to the user's Nexus Vocality account (via API).

### Training & Practice
*   ` /entrenar iniciar [nombre_rutina_o_id] `:
    *   Marks a routine as started in the user's Nexus Vocality profile.
    *   Bot could provide a link to the routine in the web app.
    *   Optionally, the bot could deliver daily exercise reminders for active routines.
*   ` /entrenar progreso `: Shows a summary of the user's training progress from Nexus Vocality.
*   ` /reto diario `: Displays the current daily vocal challenge.

### Feedback
*   ` /feedback obtener [id_grabacion_o_ultima] `: Retrieves AI feedback for a specific or the latest analyzed recording.

## Community & Gamification Features

*   **Role Progression**: Assign roles based on Nexus Vocality levels or achievements (e.g., "Vocal Novice," "Pitch Perfect").
*   **Dedicated Channels**:
    *   `#preset-gallery`: For users to share and discover presets.
    *   `#feedback-requests`: For users to share recordings and ask for peer feedback.
    *   Dynamic channels based on progress (e.g., ` #nivel-1-discusion `, ` #feminization-chat `).
*   **Leaderboards**: (Optional) For challenges or XP.
*   **Event Announcements**: For community vocal challenges or events hosted by Nexus Vocality.

## Technical Considerations

*   **Bot Hosting**: Needs a reliable server environment (e.g., Node.js on a VPS, or serverless functions).
*   **Nexus Vocality API**: The bot will heavily rely on a well-defined API for Nexus Vocality to fetch user data, presets, trigger analyses, etc.
*   **Database**: To store Discord user to Nexus Vocality user mappings, shared community presets, server configurations for the bot.
*   **Permissions**: Bot needs appropriate Discord permissions (read messages, send messages, manage roles if applicable, etc.).
*   **Rate Limiting**: Respect Discord API rate limits and implement internal rate limiting for bot commands.

## Security & Privacy

*   Ensure all API interactions are secure (HTTPS, token authentication).
*   Clearly communicate what data is being accessed from Nexus Vocality.
*   Adhere to Discord's Terms of Service and Developer Policy.

This Discord bot would aim to extend the Nexus Vocality experience into a collaborative and supportive community space.
