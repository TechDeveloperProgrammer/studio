# Public API Design for Nexus Vocality - v1 (Conceptual)

This document outlines initial design considerations for a public API for Nexus Vocality, enabling third-party developers to extend its functionality.

## Goals

*   Allow developers to create custom vocal modules, presets, and integrations.
*   Enable interaction with core Nexus Vocality features programmatically.
*   Foster a community of innovation around vocal technology.

## API Styles

A hybrid approach is recommended:

*   **REST API**: For straightforward resource manipulation (CRUD operations on presets, user data subject to permissions).
*   **GraphQL API**: For complex data queries, fetching multiple resources in a single request, and tailored data retrieval (e.g., fetching specific vocal analysis metrics for a set of recordings).

## Authentication & Authorization

*   **API Keys/Tokens**: Developers will register their applications to receive API keys.
*   **OAuth 2.0**: For user-authorized access to their data (e.g., allowing a third-party app to access a user's presets or training progress on their behalf).
*   **RBAC (Role-Based Access Control)**: Enforce permissions based on user roles and token scopes. Developers might have different access levels.

## Documentation

*   **Swagger/OpenAPI Specification**: For REST API documentation, providing an interactive way to explore endpoints.
*   **GraphQL Schema Documentation**: GraphQL's introspective nature provides schema documentation automatically. Tools like GraphiQL or GraphQL Playground should be provided.
*   Clear guides, tutorials, and SDKs (if applicable) to facilitate adoption.

## Key API Endpoint Groups (Conceptual)

### 1. User Management (REST/GraphQL)

*   `GET /users/me`: Retrieve authenticated user's profile (scoped).
*   `GET /users/{userId}/profile`: Retrieve public profile of a user (if public).
*   Endpoints for managing API tokens (developer-specific).

### 2. Presets (REST/GraphQL)

*   `GET /presets`: List public presets (with filtering/pagination).
*   `POST /presets`: Create a new public preset (if authorized).
*   `GET /users/me/presets`: List authenticated user's private presets.
*   `POST /users/me/presets`: Create a new private preset for the authenticated user.
*   `GET /presets/{presetId}`: Retrieve a specific preset.
*   `PUT /presets/{presetId}`: Update a preset (if owner/authorized).
*   `DELETE /presets/{presetId}`: Delete a preset (if owner/authorized).
*   `POST /presets/{presetId}/apply`: (Conceptual) If the API allows applying presets to an audio stream provided by the developer. This would be complex.

### 3. Vocal Analysis & AI (REST/GraphQL)

*   `POST /analysis/perform`: Submit an audio file (or data URI) for vocal analysis.
    *   Request Body: `{ audioDataUri: "...", analysisParameters: { emotion: true, clarity: true, ... } }`
    *   Response: Detailed analysis report (similar to `AnalyzeVocalPerformanceOutput`).
*   `POST /ai/personalize`: Submit user voice samples and dream voice description for personalized guidance.
    *   Request Body: `{ userVoiceSamples: ["...", "..."], dreamVoiceDescription: "..." }`
    *   Response: Personalized guidance (similar to `PersonalizeAIVoiceModelOutput`).
*   `GET /analysis/results/{analysisId}`: Retrieve results of a past analysis.

### 4. Training System (GraphQL)

*   `query GetUserProgress { ... }`: Fetch user's training progress, completed routines, achievements.
*   `query GetAvailableRoutines { ... }`: List available training routines.
*   `mutation StartRoutine(routineId: ID!) { ... }`: Start a training routine.

### 5. Webhooks

*   Allow developers to subscribe to events within Nexus Vocality (e.g., new public preset created, user achieves a milestone).
*   `POST /webhooks`: Register a new webhook URL.
*   `GET /webhooks`: List registered webhooks.
*   `DELETE /webhooks/{webhookId}`: Delete a webhook.

## Rate Limiting

*   Implement rate limiting to ensure fair usage and prevent abuse.
*   Different tiers for API access might have different rate limits.

## Versioning

*   Use API versioning (e.g., `/api/v1/...`) to manage changes and avoid breaking existing integrations.

## SDKs

*   Consider providing client SDKs (e.g., JavaScript, Python) to simplify API integration for developers.

This initial design provides a foundation. Each endpoint and data model would require detailed specification, including request/response schemas, error codes, and security considerations.
